- 👋 Hi, I’m @LizRem
- 👀 I’m interested in deep learning and machine learning applied to health data, participatory design and health equity. 
- 🌱 I’m currently in my third year of a PHD at QMUL exploring Type 2 Diabetes and the associated complications using language models applied to real world electronic healthcare records. My work is informed by a group of individuals living with Type 2 Diabetes using participatory design methods.
- 💞️ I do research for WE & AI https://weandai.org/ and volunteer with Data Science for Health Equity (DSxHE) https://www.datascienceforhealthequity.com/ as an organiser for the Statistical Methods theme.
