- 👋 Hi, I’m @LizRem
- 👀 I’m interested in AI and machine learning applied to health data, participatory design and health equity. 
- 🌱 I’m currently in my second year of a PHD at QMUL studying multiple long-term conditions using language models. My work is informed by a patient group using participatory design methods.
- 💞️ I volunteer for Data Science for Health Equity (DSxHE) https://www.datascienceforhealthequity.com/
